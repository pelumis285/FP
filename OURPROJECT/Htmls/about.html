            Started in early 1976, S.C_Motive History Cars was originally founded by the owner of the BMW dealer in Marin County, just north of San Francisco. The business consistently lost money and Bruce Trenery bought the trade name for $500 in September of 1976 and moved the business to Berkeley. Operating in a 2250 square foot building on Dwight Way, the business grew through the 1980s, selling a wide variety of special interest cars quite similar to the cars we sell today. In the mid 1980s, S.C_Motive History Cars took over the unit next door, doubling the size of the facility.

          <p>
            By 1989, the business had outgrown Dwight Way, and Bruce purchased the buildings S.C_Motive History Cars now occupies in Emeryville. Built in the early 1920s, the main building formerly served as the office for the American Rubber Manufacturing Company. A substantial rehabilitation, including seismic retrofit, was completed in 1989 in time for Monterey Car Week.

            While the area was in urban decay when S.C_Motive History Cars moved in 1989, defunct industrial companies have now been replaced by modern businesses. In the midst of this change, our discreet facility continues to supply some of the world’s finest special interest cars to collectors and enthusiasts.
